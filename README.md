# Proyect "Rastreador GNSS para Tareas Investigativas" (GNSS Tracker for investigation Tasks)

# Brief

The Firmware contain in this reposity form part of the proyect GNSS Tracker for investigation Tasks which
is the final work of the degree Electronic Engenieering from the
[Faculty of Engenieering of the University of Buenos Aires](https://www.fi.uba.ar/).
This code consist in the code upload into the tracker it self, while the others main parts of the proyect are
a [LoRa Gateway](https://github.com/FacundoBaez1994/GatewayLoRa) and the [Remote Control Server](https://github.com/joaquinelordi/Torcaza)
named Torcaza after an Argentinean dove.

The GNNS tracker system for investigative tasks, consists of an autonomous device built with the objective of getting the localization 
of himself in real time, and sending it to a remote base, in order to keep the track of a vehicle terrestrial or naval.
The device was initialy conceived for his use in the Argentinian Coast Guard, but is extrapolable to almost any LEA, 
(Law Enforcement Agent) and it was devised after a real problem.

In this proyect the Students have applied knowledge adquired in the various subjects of the carreer such as Embbebed Systems,
Algoritms, programming, PCB design, general electronics, informatic security, data communication, beetween others.

# Hardware

The hardware of the tracker consist in various OEM Modules listed:

1. Nucleo-L432KC Board from STMicroelectronics
2. BNO085 Inertial Sensor. This module consist in a Gyroscope, Accelerometer, magnetometer.
3. EC21-Aux from Quectel. GNSS-LTE Module.
4. RFM95 LoRa - which has incorporated a Semtech SX1276.
5. AT24C256 EEPROM Memory.
6. IP2312 Battery Charger

The sistem is powered by 18650 Ion-Lithium Batteries in parallel, therefore the device works with a voltage beetween
3.0V and 4.2V. Some modules works 3.3V far less than the 4.2V maximum provided by the batteries, therefore
that a few KF33BD-TR LDO Regulator have been incorporated into the circuit.

# Firmware

The firware was developed in the C++ programming languages and using the NUCLEO family develop board from ARM, making use of [mbed-os]
(https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os) which provides many usefull tools and libraries. 

C++ provides the posibility of using the paradigm of Object Oriented Programing (OOP) despite also been capable of woking at low-level bit by bit
basis requiried by any embebbed system in order to read/write registers. Sticking with the OOP paradigm and respecting all his fundamental pillars,
alow to generate easy to read/understand, easy to mantenain and reusable for future proyects code. Desing Pattern has been used such has Chain of Responsability,
Singleton, State Pattern and Decorator.

The main ruting of the firmware it can be described has a big non blocking Polling rutine based on nested State Patterns following a Class 
Hierarchy based on the level of programming or how close to the OEM Modules the Classes operates beeing Tracker the Class that sits on top
of this Hierarchy, because is the only call by main (). Despite been a polling rutine it also some interruption to handle diferents timmers.
This Polling rutine makes the Nucleo board ask to one at time modules for the information needed and accions to do in order to perform 
the tracker rutine, for example throght sending AT command at the LTE/GNNS Module make it connect to the mobile newtwoks. 

The archives are organized mostly by the standard were the ones with .h extention are class declaration (with there attributes and methods)
 and the archives with .cpp contains the implementation of the methods.

The firware is self documented using doxygen type of comentaries in almost class, function, method, enumerative type, e.g.

# Credits (Libraries used)

Outside the ones written by mbed Microcontroller Library this Firmware make uses of many libraries of
various authores customized to fit into the proyect and work properly with mbed-os. 
The following list shows all the libraries used:

- [LoRa] () by
- [CustomJWT] () by ,
- [Cypher AES] (https://os.mbed.com/users/neilt6/code/AES/) by Neil Thiessen,
- [Adafruit_BNO08x] (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_BNO08x) Adafruit library, which in turn is based on the
 CEVA [library SH2](https://github.com/ceva-dsp/sh2)
